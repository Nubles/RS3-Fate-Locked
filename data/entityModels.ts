/**
 * Resolves an unlock's name to a 3D model so the unlock reveal (and the Boss
 * Planner) can show a rotating model instead of a flat sprite.
 *
 * Auto-resolution by convention: drop a file named `<slug>.glb` into
 * /public/models (e.g. king-black-dragon.glb) and it shows up on unlock with NO
 * code changes — the manifest (data/modelManifest.ts) is regenerated before
 * dev/build, and any unlock whose slug is present resolves automatically.
 *
 * IP: OSRS models are Jagex's intellectual property — this repo does NOT bundle
 * them. You supply your own exports (e.g. via RuneMonk / RuneApps) as fan
 * content; nothing here ships a game asset. Ships DORMANT (no model files →
 * everything falls back to the existing 2D sprites).
